title: Understanding Thermodynamics online course
---

The coronavirus pandemic necessitated learning material to be moved online. 
The limited preparation time prompted academic staff to opt for solutions such as narrated PowerPoints or a blended approach making use of existing online videos. 
However, we could not find suitable material online. 
Therefore, for the introductory Mechanical Engineering Thermodynamics course, we used an innovative blend of Open Educational Resource, and sound educational principles, to produce short (±6 minute) videos explaining Engineering Thermodynamics concepts as well as providing guidance to solve illustrative problems. 
We aimed to make videos suitable for tertiary education as well as an Open Educational Resource. 
The videos were made available on the university’s Learner Management System and YouTube. 
Current metrics show a high view count in excess of 500. 
A second innovation was to convert the supporting course notes to HTML format which is much more accessible.

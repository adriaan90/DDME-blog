title: Train Dynamic Simulation Program
---

## Material handling optimisation using Engineering kinematics

[KMK Consulting Engineers](https://www.kmkengineers.com/) have an in-house software to simulate train dynamic behaviour. 
This include forces experienced by the positioner arm as well as movement profiles of individual wagons.
They are involved with numerous projects around the world on handling train and wagons in various industries and they felt the need to take their software to the next level. 
The requirement was to bring the software up to date with new built-in criteria to enable enhanced capabilities asd well as increase the customisability of the software. 
This will enable the company to have a better knowledge/understanding of the train simulation and add/remove modelling functionality. 
Such a simulation tool is a highly demanded tool in railway industry and material handling for re-assuring the end users and increase handling efficiency. 
To proceed, [KMK Consulting Engineers](https://www.kmkengineers.com/) required the expertise from a dynamic point of view to lead the development of the software.

The scope of this project includes:

### Project Phase 1: Research and Scoping Study

1.	Conduct research exploring the theory of longitudinal train modelling. This include how to model individual wagon movement behaviour and how this effect the forces experienced by the positioner arm.

2.	Determine the coupling method including slack action and how this can be modelled.

3.	Investigate how track curvature and track elevation influences train behaviour and how these effects can be modelled.

### Project Phase 2: Modelling and Validation

4.	Construct the model  and add increasing sophistication after each step has been validated. 

5.	Validate final results with existing software provided by [KMK Consulting Engineers](https://www.kmkengineers.com/).

### Project Phase 3: Graphical User Interface

6.	Building a graphical user interface front end using GUI features of MATLAB.

The end result is an unique and fully customisable train simulation software backed up with dynamic mathematical inputs.
It will enable analysis of train pulling loads through unique as well as individual wagon coupler loads.

Hamed Khosravi, Project director of [KMK Consulting Engineers](https://www.kmkengineers.com/) has the following to say after the project concluded:

> Adriaan has provided an invaluable service supplying us with a high-fidelity software tool for the use of train simulation program in materials handling; enabling us to continue to innovate and grow our business. 
With KMKâ€™s input Adriaan developed a modern and functional tool which will help us to meet project and client demands and offer an innovative problem solving around train dynamic simulation topic.
This latest work between KMK and Adriaan has led to develop a software with functionality and the inability to improve our analysis tools that are required to keep our competitive edge. 
Adriaan, through his pool of knowledge and expertise, has never let us down and I would have no hesitation in recommending him.
Beside his technical expertise, Adriaan has a very approachable and friendly personality that makes working with him ever so easy. 
We are very pleased to announce that Adriaan will be working closely with KMK company acting as an associate and advisor for new innovative projects and ideas.
